# Python 3
This manual describes briefly how to install Python 3 on Windows.

##System requirements
####Recommended

##Installation
This chapter describes where Python can be downloaded and how to install Python correctly.

###Download
Click at the [Python 3 download](https://www.python.org/getit/) link to get at the download page of Python. Download the latest version of Python 3, e.g:
`Python 3.5.2.exe`

###Install Python
**Run** your downloaded `python-3.#.#.exe` file. Run through the default setup, nothing has to be changed.

> **WARNING:** Don't forget to notate the install folder. For this manual, `C:\Python` is used.

Open the **Command Prompt** and navigate to the install folder. This can be done in three ways:

1. **Open** your installation folder. Click on **File** and then on **Open Command Prompt**.
2. Also **open** your installation folder. Type *'cmd'* in the navigation bar and hit enter.
3. Click the **Windows button**, type *'cmd'* and hit the enter button. Then navigate to the install folder by typing: 

```
cd C:\Python
```

To test if Python is working, you can start Python with the following command:

```
python.exe
```

The following code will execute a print statement:

```
print("Python works!")
```
